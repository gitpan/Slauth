Slauth version 0.01
===================

Slauth is a set of Perl modules which manage authentication and authorization
functions under mod_perl for Apache 2.  It has a plugin architecture allowing
multiple approaches for administration and user registration.  It currently
handles HTTP Basic and cookie authentication, depending on which is selected
in any given directory.  Slauth supports virtual servers with independent
configurations.

HISTORY

Slauth was originally developed for use by Stratofox, an amateur aerospace
tracking and recovery team.  (Sometimes this has also been called
"nearspacecraft hunting".)

The ability to have users self-register based on Mailman mail list
subscriptions resulted mostly from discussions with two rocket-building
groups that Stratofox works with.  The rocket-builders parted paths and
didn't want each other's private information available to the other.
At the time both were nearly ready to attmept the first non-government
space launch.  After some discussion, this capability was developed by
Stratofox during the search for an acceptable method to continue to
work with both groups and continue to participate in their launches.

INSTALLATION

Note: instead of using ExtUtils::MakeMaker, the installation process is
based on Module::Build (which is intended to supersede it.)  The process
is similar, using Build.PL instead of Makefile.PL and our own generated
Build script (made by Build.PL) instead of your system's make command.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   Build
   Build test
   Build install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	mod_perl for Apache 2.0, CGI, CGI::Carp, CGI::Cookie, Digest::MD5,
	IO::File
